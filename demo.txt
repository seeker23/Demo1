Structura prezentare:
- Purpose of terraform private registry
	 Terraform cloud s private registry work similarly to the public terraform registry (registry.terraform.io), 
	 registry that moust of you heard or already are using, and it helps you share accross the organization terraform providers or terraform modules.
- How do we find providers available for instalation?
	Implement Provider registry protocol
	Is what terraform cli uses to discover metadata about providers available accross the organization for installation and to locate the distribution packages for the selected provider.
	Basically the protocol is helping identify providers available for installation.
- Flow of terraform provider registry protocol
	Each terraform provider has an associated address which uniquely identifies it within Terraform file.The provider address look like this: hostname/namespace/type;
	Where the hostname is the registry host, the namespace is the purpose within eatch organization and type is the provider name, something line aws, azurerm.
	
	Components of the protocol:
	 - Service Discovery
	 - List available versions :namespace/:type/versions
	 - Find the provider package 	:namespace/:type/:version/download/:os/:arch
	 - Download provider package content 	:namespace/:type/:version/download/:os/:arch/filename


	The flow of downloading and installing terraform providers starts with service discovery, witch happens through this endpoint <hostname>/.well-known/terraform.json. When a user ask for a provider, custom provider, terraform will contact the provider s hostname and ask for the implementations of any of its protocols that are found as a result of calling the descovery endpoint.
	Also terraform provider registry protocol establishes two further operations: List available versions and find provider package.
	List available versions allows terraform to query for existing versions of a given provider based on what it was configured in the required_provider section in terraform files
	Find a provider package allows terraform to get information about where to download a particular package of a provider habing extra argument like os and architecture.
